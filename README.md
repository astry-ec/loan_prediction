# IBM Final Project for Machine Learning with Python course

To finish this IBM course provided by Coursera, I have to finish this project. I created model using the following algorithm :

*   K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
*   Decision Tree
*   Support Vector Machine
*   Logistic Regression

The model built using Loan_train.csv dataset. After finding the model based on each algorithm, I used Loan_test.csv (another dataset which never seen by the model) to train the model and see the score in the evaluation matrix

## 1. About Dataset

This dataset is about past loans. The **Loan_train.csv** data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

| Field          | Description                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loan_status    | Whether a loan is paid off on in collection                                           |
| Principal      | Basic principal loan amount at the                                                    |
| Terms          | Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule |
| Effective_date | When the loan got originated and took effects                                         |
| Due_date       | Since itâ€™s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date                |
| Age            | Age of applicant                                                                      |
| Education      | Education of applicant                                                                |
| Gender         | The gender of applicant                                                               |

Model will predict the customer from **Loan_test.csv** whether they likely to "Paid Off" the loan or the loan will keep hanging on "Collection" after the due date
